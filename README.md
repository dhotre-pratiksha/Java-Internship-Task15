Java Internship Task 15 – Multithreading Ticket Booking Simulation

This project demonstrates:
- Java multithreading using Thread class
- Shared resource handling
- Race condition and its prevention using synchronized
- Thread-safe ticket booking logic
- Use of sleep() to simulate real-time delay
- Clear logging of thread execution

This task helped me understand concurrency control in Java.
